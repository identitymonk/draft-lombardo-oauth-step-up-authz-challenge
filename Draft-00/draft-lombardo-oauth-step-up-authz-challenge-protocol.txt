           OAuth 2.0 step-up authorization challenge protocol
      draft-lombardo-oauth-step-up-authz-challenge-protocol-latest

Abstract

   It is not uncommon for resource servers to require additional
   information like details of delegation authorization, or assurance
   proof of the delegation of authorization mechanism used according to
   the characteristics of a request.  This document introduces a
   mechanism that resource servers can use to signal to a client that
   the data and metadata associated with the access token of the current
   request does not meet its authorization requirements and, further,
   how to meet them.  This document also codifies a taxonomy to guide
   the client into starting a new request towards the authorization
   server in order to get issued, if applicable, a new set of tokens
   matching the requirements.

1.  Introduction

   In simple API authorization scenarios, an authorization server will
   determine what claims to embed in the tokkens to issue on the basis
   of aspects such as the scopes requested, the resource, the identity
   of the client, and other characteristics known a provisioning time.
   Although that approach is viable in many situations, it falls short
   in several important circumstances.  Consider, for instance, a FAPI
   2.0 or SMART on FHIR regulated API requiring peculiar client
   authentication mechanism to be enforced or transaction specific
   details to be present in the token depending on whether the resource
   being accessed need to meet some rules estimated by the API itself,
   or a policy decision point it relies on, using a logic that is opaque
   to the authorization server.

   This document extends the collection of error codes defined by
   [RFC6750] and by [RFC9470] with a new error codes,
   insufficient_delegated_authorization and new_authorization_needed,
   which can be used by resource servers to signal to clients that the
   authorization delegation represented by the access token presented
   with the request does not meet the authorization requirements of the
   resource server.  This document also introduces associated payload
   definitions.  The resource server can use these payloads to
   explicitly communicate to the client the required authorization
   details required.

   The client can use that information to reach back to the
   authorization server with through a new authorization request that
   specifies the additional authorization details required to be
   described in the tokens to be issued.  This document does not
   describe new methods to perform the new authorization request but
   will rely on OAuth 2.0 Rich Auhtorization Request [RFC9396], OAuth
   2.0 Pushed Authorization Request [RFC9126], or OAuth 2.0 JWT-Secured
   Authorization Request [RFC9101].

   Those extensions will make it possible to implement interoperable
   step up authorization with minimal work from resource servers,
   clients, and authorization servers.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
   server", "authorization endpoint", "authorization request", "client",
   "protected resource", and "resource server" defined by [RFC6749].

3.  Protocol Overview

   The following is an end-to-end sequence of a typical step up
   authorization scenario implemented according to this specification.
   The scenario assumes that, before the sequence described below takes
   place, the client already obtained an access token for the protected
   resource.

   _Figure 1: Abstract Protocol Flow_

   1.  The client requests a protected resource, presenting an access
       token.

   2.  The resource server determines that the circumstances in which
       the presented access token was obtained offer insufficient
       authorization details, wrong grant flow, or inadequate client
       authentication mechanism; hence, it denies the request and
       returns a challenge describing (using a combination of error code
       and payload details) what authorization details requirements must
       be met for the resource server to allow a request.

   3.  The client directs the user agent to the authorization server
       with an authorization request that includes the authorization
       details indicated by the resource server in the previous step.

   4.  Whatever sequence required by the grant of choice plays out; this
       will include the necessary steps to authenticate the client in
       accordance with the playoad, to use the required grant flow type,
       or to validate that the authorization details are met.  Then, the
       authorization server returns a new access token to the client.
       The new access token contains or references information about the
       elements required, including but not limited to what
       [I-D.lombardo-oauth-client-extension-claims] defines.

   5.  The client repeats the request from step 1, presenting the newly
       obtained access token.

   6.  The resource server finds that the authorization details, grant
       flow, or client authentication mechanism used during the
       acquisition of the new access token complies with its
       requirements and returns the representation of the requested
       protected resource.

   The validation operations mentioned in steps 2 and 6 imply that the
   resource server has a way of evaluating, on top of the requirements
   of authentication as defined in [RFC9470], the authorization
   requirements that occurred during the process by which the access
   token was obtained.  In the context of this document, the assessment
   by the resource server of the specific authorization mechanisms used
   to obtain a token for the requested resource is called an
   "authorization state".

   This document will not describe how the resource server can perform
   this assessment of the authorization state whatever the access token
   is a JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC9068] or is validated via introspection
   [RFC7662] and whatever the resource provider is performing this
   assessment natively or by offloading the assessment to a policy
   decision point as defined in [XACML] and NIST's ABAC [SP.800-162]
   Still, this document describes how the resource provider can signal
   to the client any insatisfying authorization is expected to be
   obtained from the authorization server if applicable.

   The terms "authorization state" and "step up" are metaphors in this
   specification.  These metaphors do not suggest that there is an
   absolute hierarchy of authorization states expressed in interoperable
   fashion.  The notion of a state emerges from the fact that the
   resource server may only want to accept certain authorization
   mechanisms.  When presented with a token derived from particuliar
   authorization mechanisms (i.e., a given authorization state) that it
   does not want to accept (i.e., below the threshold it will accept),
   the resource server seeks to step up (i.e., renegotiate) from the
   current authorization state to one that it may accept.  The "step up"
   metaphor is intended to convey a shift from the original
   authorization state to one that is acceptable to the resource server.

   Although the case in which the new access token supersedes old tokens
   by virtue of a higher authorization state is common, in line with the
   connotation of the term "step up authorization", it is important to
   keep in mind that this might not necessarily hold true in the general
   case.  For example, for a particular request, a resource server might
   require a higher authorization state and a shorter validity,
   resulting in a token suitable for one-off calls but leading to
   frequent prompts: hence, offering a suboptimal user experience if the
   token is reused for routine operations.  In such a scenario, the
   client would be better served by keeping both the old tokens, which
   are associated with a lower authorization state, and the new one:
   selecting the appropriate token for each API call.  This is not a new
   requirement for clients, as incremental consent and least-privilege
   principles will require similar heuristics for managing access tokens
   associated with different scopes and permission levels.  This
   document does not recommend any specific token-caching strategy: that
   choice will be dependent on the characteristics of every particular
   scenario and remains application-dependent as in the core OAuth
   cases.  Also recall that OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] assumes access tokens
   are treated as opaque by clients.  The token format might be
   unreadable to the client or might change at any time to become
   unreadable.  So, during the course of any token-caching strategy, a
   client must not attempt to inspect the content of the access token to
   determine the associated authentication information or other details
   (see Section 6 of [RFC9068] for a more detailed discussion).

4.  Authorization Requirements Challenge

4.1.  HTTP Error Status Code

   When a request compliant with this specification does not meet the
   authorization state requirements, the resource server responds using
   the 403 HTTP status code.

4.2.  Error Codes

   This specification introduces two new error code value for the
   challenge of the Bearer authentication scheme's error parameter (from
   [RFC6750]) and other OAuth authentication schemes, such as those seen
   in [RFC9449], which use the same error parameter:

   insufficient_delegated_authorization:  The authorization mechansisms
      used for the issuance of the access token presented with the
      request does not meet the authorization state requirements of the
      protected resource.  It is up to the client to decide what to
      perform next.

   new_authorization_needed:  The authorization mechansisms used for the
      issuance of the access token presented with the request does not
      meet the authorization state requirements of the protected
      resource.  The client is guided on why new authorization
      mechanisms and details SHOULD be used through a new authorization
      request to the authorization server.

   Note: the logic through which the resource server determines that the
   current request does not meet the authorization state requirements of
   the protected resource, and associated functionality (such as
   expressing, deploying and publishing such requirements), is out of
   scope for this document.
