                 OAuth2 Step-Up Authorization Challenge
      draft-lombardo-oauth-step-up-authz-challenge-protocol-latest

Abstract

   It is not uncommon for resource servers to require more details
   information the characteristics of a request.  This document
   introduces a mechanism that resource servers can use to signal to a
   client that the details about the Subject, Action, Resource, and
   Context do not meet its authorization requirements and, further, how
   to meet them.  This document also codifies a mechanism for guiding a
   client into shaping a rich or pushed authorization request towards
   the authorization server in order to acquire, if authorized, a new
   set of tokens that could match the expectations of the resource
   provider.
